# SimoClock
The unnecessary digital clock!

Just a simple digital clock, with some useless options. I am not a developer, i was just curious about what i could do using chatGPT.
Just have fun with it :)
It works on Windows OS (due to the Swing framework).
Clone or copy 'SimoClock.java' in your '/jdk/bin/' folder.
To run it, you need a JDK (8+).
```
/path/to/your/jdk/bin/java.exe SimoClock.java
```
To launch it with dos window hidden:
```
/path/to/your/jdk/bin/javaw.exe SimoClock.java
```
